This website is a single page web application made using Javascript and Django. I configured several API routes using Django in the backend. 
I accessed the same API routes using 'fetch' function to make requests to the server without having to reload or change the Webpage. 
Functions like accessing the Inbox, Sent mails, Archived mails was carried out using API routes to access the database and Javascript to manipulate the HTML contents
of the page.
Mail.mp4 is a demonstration of the website.
